## Prerequisites

## Reddit API Credentials

4. After creating the app, you'll receive:
   - `client_id` (listed under the app name)
   - `client_secret`
   - A `username` and `password` (for the Reddit account that created the app)


### Installation

Fork/Clone the repository and navigate to the project directory:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/factorion-bot.git
cd factorion-bot
```

### Configuration

Create a `.env` file in the project root with the following variables:

```env
CLIENT_ID=<your_client_id>
CLIENT_SECRET=<your_client_secret>
USERNAME=<reddit_app_username>
PASSWORD=<reddit_app_password>
SUBREDDITS=<subreddits>
```

Replace `<your_client_id>`, `<your_client_secret>`, `<reddit_app_username>`, and `<reddit_app_password>` with the values you received from the Reddit App creation.

## Run the following command to install dependencies:

##### Refer to `Cargo.toml`

```bash
cargo build
```

## Usage

Run the bot with:

```bash
cargo run
```
### How does it work in Reddit?
1. Create a new user for the bot so it can be mentioned by `/u/<botname>`

2. Create a new subreddit `/r/<botname>` as a test play ground.
